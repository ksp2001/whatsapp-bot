# SELENIUM WHATSAPP BOT

A WhatsApp Bot that can be used to send messages programmatically, without actually typing out a response. The goal going forward for the project is to have a bot that replies to messages coming in when the user is set to Do Not Disturb, instead of not replying to users at all. This is particularly useful if one uses Whatsapp for Business.
